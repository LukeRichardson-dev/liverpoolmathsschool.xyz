       </p>
       <p>
        John has worked in all settings and phases in education, with all levels of ability ranging from children as young as 3 through to mature university students who at the time were twice his age. He moved from being Head of PE in a Specialist Sports College (where his A Level class was made up of 12 students of whom 6 were county standard, 3 internationals and a World record holder who went on to win an Olympic Silver Medal) to Special Needs Education which has, as his knees have given up, become as big a passion for John as sport ever was. His passion for education has led him to become Head of School at an Outstanding Merseyside SEN School.
       </p>
       <p>
        In John’s free time he is a fan of Newcastle United, enjoys cinema, reading, current affairs, cycling, sport and cooking. Cooking almost became John’s profession at one point when he appeared in the TV Show – Iron Chef UK and following his experience went on to work in Michelin Starred kitchens becoming at the time the only amateur to have been invited to cook at Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck. John is dyslexic and finds the differences in the way people learn fascinating and as a result he has a very creative approach to developing teaching and learning to meet the individual needs of the students. He hopes that his experience will serve and support the University of Liverpool Maths School well.

After some years as Postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg (Germany, 2003-2004) and as Fellow at CERN (Switzerland, 2005-2007) Carsten founded the QUASAR Group in 2007. He has been a member of the academic staff at the University of Liverpool and a member of the Cockcroft Institute of Accelerator Science and Technology since 2008. In 2011 he was promoted to Full Professor of Physics and has been Head of the Physics Department since September 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Carsten is also Head of the Accelerator Physics and QUASAR Groups. Carsten has initiated and is coordinating the EU-funded research and training networks DITANET, LA3NET, oPAC, OMA and AVA. He is also Director of Liverpool University’s STFC CDT on Big Data Science, LIV.DAT. With a combined budget of more than 20 million pounds these are the largest research and training initiatives ever realised in this research area. Carsten has organised dozens of international schools and topical workshops for Liverpool University students, staff and the wider scientific community. As a member of various scientific advisory committees he contributes to defining future research trends and the advancement of physics in general.

As Head of Liverpool University’s Physics Department, Carsten sees particular value in ULMaS for future generations of students and for positioning Liverpool as a destination of choice for physical sciences in the UK and around the world. His experience in the design of teaching practice at undergraduate and postgraduate level, as well as numerous outreach activities communicating cutting edge science to GCSE and A-level audiences will be an asset in defining the strategic direction of the School. Carsten’s experience in attracting significant funding from a large range of funders will also be beneficial to the long-term growth and stability of ULMaS.
