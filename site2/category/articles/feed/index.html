    <![CDATA[<p class="introduction"><strong>We believe that it is crucial for students to have a level of competence in programming language.</strong></p>
<p>Coding empowers you to solve problems and build digital tools, so we want to ensure that all our students are confident coders and are able to use a choice of programming languages depending on the problem they are trying to solve, or the solution they are developing.</p>
<p>At the Maths School you will be able to take AS Computer Science, in addition to A Level Maths, Further Maths and Physics. We teach AS Level Computer Science because coding is incredibly useful and it will help you with Maths and Physics, as a lot of the concepts are the same: algebra, functions, set theory and logic. By studying AS Computer Science you will learn how computer and programming languages are built on a foundation of mathematical logic, whilst giving you the knowledge and freedom to explore coding in a few different languages.</p>
<p>If you think that you don’t like computer programming or that it isn’t for you, our opinion is that you probably haven’t properly been shown what it is. Coding is not a dull mechanical process but something creative and enjoyable, where you create abstract objects which can be used as part of more complex creations. Some people think they won’t like coding because they have a stereotype in their minds about what a coder is like, but we would like to challenge that way of thinking.</p>
<p>If you wish to progress to take the full A-Level in Computer Science you will be able to do so.&nbsp; We expect to have at least one class each year that chooses not to take the AS examinations in Year 12 but continues straight on to the full A-Level course.&nbsp; There will also be plenty of opportunities to experiment and use your coding knowledge in projects to enhance your learning of maths and physics.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p>The public consultation for the University of Liverpool Mathematics School for sixth formers&nbsp; launches today (Monday, 16 September 2019).</p>
<p>Members of the public, stakeholders, parents, guardians and teachers are invited to feedback on the School’s proposals via a <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematics-school/consultation">short online survey</a> or by attending an open house event.</p>
<p>Due to open in September 2020, the University of Liverpool’s Maths School is the first specialist mathematics school in the North of England. It will offer 16 – 19 year olds the opportunity to study an innovative and challenging A Level curriculum centred on Maths, Further Maths and Physics.</p>
<p>The School will also work with partners to raise attainment and interest in mathematics for pupils of all ages and abilities across the whole Liverpool City Region. It also seeks to address the gender imbalance that currently exists in mathematical sciences.</p>
<p>The School is hosting an open house event on <strong>Thursday 26 September, between 5.00 and 7.30pm in the Liverpool Guild of Students</strong> (160 Mount Pleasant L3 5TR), which will provide an opportunity to find out more about the Maths School and discuss plans with the Headteacher, Damian Haigh, in greater detail.</p>
<p>People are also invited to submit their views via an<a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematics-school/consultation"> online survey</a> which runs until 25 October 2019: <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematics-school/consultation">https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematics-school/consultation</a></p>
<p>Headteacher Damian Haigh said: “Our new specialist Maths School will create a centre of excellence for maths education in the Liverpool City Region. In addition to providing an environment and curriculum for talented and passionate young mathematicians, our outreach work will bring wider benefits to schools, colleges and pupils across the region. I’m keen to hear what parents and guardians, teaching professionals and the general public think of our plans.”</p>
<p><strong>The consultation launches on 16 September and runs until 25 October 2019.</strong></p>

    <![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematics-school/">University of Liverpool Mathematics School,</a> due to open in September 2020, has appointed Damian Haigh as its founding headteacher.</p>
<p>Damian is from South Yorkshire and studied at Cambridge University before returning to Sheffield to take a PGCE at Sheffield Hallam University. For the last eleven years he has been a school leader in Wilmslow High School.&nbsp;In 2008 he became Director of Learning and Assessment, and more recently became Director of Research &amp; Development whilst also working as an Evidence Lead in Education for the Aspirer Research School.</p>
<p>He has taught Further Mathematics and STEP mathematics for over twenty years and is particularly interested in helping teachers make use of research findings about memory, cognition and effective teaching.</p>
<p>The University of Liverpool Mathematics School will take in 80 A-Level pupils per year to study Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science and Physics.</p>
<p>In addition to offering a challenging and innovative A Level curriculum, the School will work with schools, colleges and education partners to raise attainment and interest in mathematics for pupils of all ages and abilities across the whole Liverpool City Region. It also seeks to address the gender imbalance that currently exists in the study of Further Maths.</p>
<p>Damian said: “I am thrilled and honoured to have been appointed as the first headteacher of the University of Liverpool Mathematics School. To be given the opportunity to play a key role in developing such a special school is beyond anything I’ve ever dreamt of. To do so in a city as vibrant and welcoming as Liverpool makes it even better.</p>
<p>“There are great opportunities ahead of us and I look forward to working with colleagues in schools, colleges and universities across the Liverpool region over the years ahead. My ambition is to create an exceptional school which delivers a great education to students with a vocation in mathematics whilst also taking seriously its responsibility to help all students studying mathematics across the region. I can&#8217;t wait to get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Gavin Brown, Chair of the University of Liverpool Mathematics School Board of Trustees, said: “I am delighted to announce the appointment of Damian as the new headteacher for our new specialist Mathematics School.</p>
<p>&#8220;In his application and at interview Damian offered an inspiring vision of how our City Region’s Mathematics education can become the best in the country and prepare our young people for inspirational future study and fulfilling careers. All of the Trustees and supporters of the school are looking forward to supporting Damian with his ambitious and exciting plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new School will be located in the Alastair Pilkington Building on the University campus, where it will benefit from the close proximity and association with the University’s Department of Mathematical Sciences, before moving to a permanent home close to campus.</p>
<p>The University of Liverpool Mathematics School, supported by the Department for Education, will follow in the footsteps of successful schools opened by King’s College London and the University of Exeter in partnership with Exeter College.</p>
